# printf
Are you tired of ft_putstr and ft_putnbr? Are you not allowed to use printf? Code your own! This will be an opportunity to discover a feature of the C - the variadic functions - and train you to fine management of display options. You will then have the right to use your printf in all your subsequent projects.
